## Section Explanations

### Overview
The overview section should provide enough context for any team member to understand:
- What the feature does and why it's needed
- How it fits into the larger system
- Any technical or business constraints
- Dependencies on other features or systems

### Phase 1: Test Design
This phase follows the first step of TDD: writing failing tests. Each test case should:
- Have a clear, specific purpose
- Test one behavior at a time
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Consider edge cases and boundary conditions

#### Unit Tests Example
```python
def test_process_instance_creation():
    """Test successful process instance creation"""
    # Arrange
    process_def_id = UUID('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000')
    variables = {'key': 'value'}
    
    # Act
    instance = create_process_instance(process_def_id, variables)
    
    # Assert
    assert instance.status == ProcessStatus.ACTIVE
    assert instance.variables == variables
    assert instance.definition_id == process_def_id
```

#### Integration Tests Example
```python
def test_process_execution_with_database():
    """Test process execution with database integration"""
    # Arrange
    process_def = create_test_process_definition()
    db.save(process_def)
    
    # Act
    instance = execute_process(process_def.id)
    
    # Assert
    saved_instance = db.get_instance(instance.id)
    assert saved_instance.status == ProcessStatus.COMPLETED
    assert saved_instance.end_time is not None
```

### Phase 2: Implementation
This phase implements the minimum code needed to make tests pass. Each implementation task should:
- Focus on satisfying test requirements
- Follow SOLID principles
- Include proper error handling
- Consider performance implications

#### Implementation Example
```python
def create_process_instance(
    definition_id: UUID,
    variables: Dict[str, Any]
) -> ProcessInstance:
    """Create a new process instance"""
    try:
        instance = ProcessInstance(
            definition_id=definition_id,
            status=ProcessStatus.ACTIVE,
            variables=variables
        )
        return db.save(instance)
    except DatabaseError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create process instance: {e}")
        raise ProcessCreationError(f"Database error: {e}")
```

### Phase 3: Refactoring
This phase improves code quality without changing behavior. Focus on:
- Code organization and clarity
- Performance optimization
- Removing duplication
- Improving test structure

#### Refactoring Example
```python
# Before refactoring
def handle_process_error(instance_id, error):
    instance = db.get_instance(instance_id)
    instance.status = ProcessStatus.ERROR
    instance.error = str(error)
    instance.end_time = datetime.now()
    db.save(instance)
    
# After refactoring
def handle_process_error(instance_id: UUID, error: Exception) -> None:
    """Update process instance status on error"""
    with db.transaction():
        instance = ProcessInstance.get_by_id(instance_id)
        instance.mark_as_failed(error)
        instance.save()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Design
- Write tests before implementation
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 2. Implementation
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- Follow SOLID principles
- Handle errors appropriately
- Document public interfaces
- Consider performance implications

### 3. Refactoring
- Maintain test coverage
- Apply design patterns appropriately
- Remove code duplication
- Improve naming and organization
- Optimize performance carefully

### 4. Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Include code examples
- Document edge cases
- Explain error scenarios
- Provide usage examples

## Using This Guide

1. Create a new file for each feature implementation
2. Copy the template structure
3. Fill in each section with specific details
4. Follow the TDD cycle: Red (failing test) → Green (passing test) → Refactor
5. Update the document as implementation progresses
6. Use the Definition of Done as a final checklist

Remember that this is a living document - update it as you implement the feature and learn more about the requirements and constraints.
