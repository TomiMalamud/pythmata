# Process Variables

Process variables are key-value pairs that store data within a process instance. They can be accessed and modified by tasks during process execution.

## Variable Types

Pythmata supports the following variable types:

- String
- Number (Integer/Float)
- Boolean
- JSON/Dictionary
- List/Array
- Date/Time
- Binary Data

## Defining Variables

Variables can be defined in several ways:

1. Process Definition
2. Process Instance Creation
3. Task Execution

## Variable Scope

Variables have different scopes:

- Process Level
- Sub-process Level
- Multi-instance Level

## Best Practices

1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Document variable purposes
3. Consider variable lifecycle
4. Handle variable persistence
5. Implement proper error handling
